### What is they.whiteboarded.me?
they.whiteboarded.me aims to be a crowd-sourced and curated list of companies that
engage in good and bad interview practices. This allows job-seekers to only engage
with companies whose interview processes are a good fit for them.

### What is the mission of they.whiteboarded.me?
To promote diversity and inclusivity for all tech practitioners, regardless
of experience level, educational background, race, ethnicity, sexual
orientation, religion, etc.

It is no secret that the tech sector is growing at an unprecedented rate,
accelerating every day. With this growth, companies cannot hire candidates fast
enough.

However, many companies will not stop these practices until they have a good
reason for doing so. We, as tech workers, must provide that reason. If
we slow growth by refusing to submit to demoralizing interviews, we have the
capability to effect change in our industry.

### How is this different than Glassdoor?
While [Glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com) allows you to submit a review of
a given company's interview process, it is not tech-focused. Additionally,
discovery of what companies do whiteboarding / live-coding vs. those who do not
is very difficult on Glassdoor.

### Why should I believe this random website?
Here is a [curated list](/additional_resources.html) of relevant links, sources
and additional resources for your consideration and further perusal.

### How do I submit changes?

## Tech interviews

### What types of applicant evaluations are there?
There are three major types of applicant evaluations, which will be discussed
separately:

1. [Whiteboarding and live
   coding](/interview_types/whiteboarding_and_live_coding.html).
2. [Online coding challenges](/interview_types/online_coding_challenges.html).
3. [Homework assignments](/interview_types/homework.html).

## How do we fix this?

### Alternatives to stressful interviews
Some companies are beginning to adopt homework / take-home assignments as
a screening tool. These are not without their problems as discussed above. Other
companies are developing apprenticeship programs to specifically target and
develop talent which might not do well in a tech interview.

### What can I do to help?
- Please help keep this site up-to-date by submitting a {% include
  pull_requests.md text="pull request" %} or by {% include anonymous_post.md
  text="posting anonymously" %}.
- Refuse to interview at companies that use these stressful interview
  practices.

### Your site design and layout sucks!
Hey, that's an opinion, not a question :). Anyway, I am not a professional web
developer. I'm the person who keeps your web servers running ;). That said, if
you're particularly skilled with CSS and Jekyll, {% include pull_requests.md
%} are welcome and encouraged!
