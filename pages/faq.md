## Whiteboarding and live-coding
### What is whiteboarding?
Whiteboarding is the practice of asking a technical job interview applicant to
write code to a pet problem, typically on a dry-erase whiteboard. While
originally promoted as a way to inspire conversation about a candidates’
approach to a problem, the use and meaning of whiteboarding has morphed into
“Implement Foo algorithm,” on the whiteboard. This is wrong because it assumes
rote memorization of a given algorithm or the steps needed to solve a particular
problem.

### What is live-coding?
Live-coding is a practice very similar to whiteboarding. The difference is,
a candidate may be able to use a computer. Whether or not they can compile / run
their code depends heavily upon the environment provided to the candidate. Some
companies just use a Google Doc. Others use purpose-built tooling such as
Coderpad, Stypi, etc.

### Why is whiteboarding and live-coding bad?
Whiteboarding and live-coding is a bad practice because these skills are
discrete from those required for most software engineering positions. These
interviews only measure a candidate's interview skills; not their actual
technical skills.


## Online Coding Challenges
### What are online coding challenges?
An online coding challenge is a coding assignment typically given to a candidate
using an automated platform such as Leetcode, Hackerrank, Codility, et. al.

These require a candidate to complete a given coding problem using their web
browser. Candidate solutions are ran and verified against problem constraints
using a series of visible and invisible (to the candidate) tests.

### What benefits do online coding challenges have?
They allow companies to inexpensively screen candidates as a precursor to
a phone screen / onsite interview.

### Why are online coding challenges bad?
Online coding challenges limit your ability to ask questions about the problem
to determine scope / approach / etc. This is crucial because some of these
problems are very poorly worded. You also gain a countdown timer ticking away
next to your code as well as hidden test cases that aren't run until after you
press "Submit". Testing your solution forces you to use a web form or some
foreign syntax to specify your test cases.

Experienced engineers often tailor their dev environments and editors to their
specific tastes and preferences. Asking a candidate to code in something other
than their preferred editor with their preferred config / plugins will cause
them to slow down dramatically. When you're being timed to complete something,
this feels like an unnecessary handicap.

These can also introduce ableist bias. For example, if you require a screen
reader, the interview platform you're using may not work well with screen
readers. If you require an alternative input device, you might not be able to
enter code as quickly as someone who can use a standard keyboard / mouse.

Lastly, these can introduce participation bias. For example, if you have
out-of-work obligations such as caring for a family, you may not necessarily
have the availability of uninterrupted time necessary to complete a coding
challenge. Some can take up to several hours.

## Homework
### What are homework assignments?
Homework assignments, sometimes also called "take-home tests" or "take-home
interviews" typically include a problem definition and instructions for
a candidate to complete them in their choice of programming language, with their
choice of development and testing frameworks. Typically, a candidate uses their
own computer in their own home, uses their editor of choice and has a reasonable
deadline with which to complete this assignment.

Online coding challenges should not be confused with homework assignments.

### What benefits do homework assignments have?
Candidates can complete them on their own time and with their own tools and
environment at their disposal. Candidates can look up references for various
things on the Internet.

These can transform a technical interview into a code review session which can
be significantly less stressful. Additionally, this frees up onsite interview
time for evaluating whether the candidate would be a good fit, culture-wise.

### Why are homework assignments bad?
They can be very time-intensive, depending on the nature of the assignment and
what the company has in mind. If a candidate is applying at several companies,
they only have a finite amount of time to do homework assignments with.

Homework assignments sometimes get conflated with being asked to do work for
free. Additionally, there is the problem of introducing participation bias for
those who have out-of-work obligations such as caring for a family, etc.

Some companies do not allow candidates to post their solutions to homework
problems online.

Some companies believe that candidates cheat, by having others do their
assignments for them. While possible, this is easily verified during a simple
phone interview.

Lastly, engineers who have a strong GitHub profile already have a demonstrable
body of work they can (and should) be able to present for a competency
evaluation instead of being asked to waste time completing a homework
assignment. Even another company's homework assignment can (and should) be used
as an example of a candidate's competency.

## How do we fix this?

### Alternatives to stressful interviews
Some companies are beginning to adopt homework / take-home assignments as
a screening tool. These are not without their problems as discussed above. Other
companies are developing apprenticeship programs to specifically target and
develop talent which might not do well in a tech interview.

### What can I do to help?
- Please help keep this site up-to-date by submitting [pull
  requests](http://github.com/cheesesashimi/theywhiteboardedme) or [anonymous
  updates](https://goo.gl/forms/Usy158YeCBA99wT53).
- Refuse to interview at companies that use these stressful interview
  practices.

### What is the mission of they.whiteboarded.me?
To promote diversity and even the field for all tech practitioners, regardless
of experience level, educational background, race, ethnicity, sexual
orientation, religion, etc.

It is no secret that the tech sector is growing at an unprecedented rate,
accelerating every day. With this growth, companies cannot hire candidates fast
enough.

However, many companies will not stop these practices until they have a good
reason for doing so. We, as tech workers, must provide them with that reason. If
we slow growth by refusing to submit to demoralizing interviews, we have the
capability to effect change in our industry. To that end, this site exists to
provide everyone with a list of companies that engage in these questionable
practices.

### Your site design and layout sucks!
Hey, that's an opinion, not a question ;). Anyway, I am not a professional web
developer. I'm the person who keeps your web servers running ;). That said, if
you're particularly skilled with CSS and Jekyll, [pull
requests](http://github.com/cheesesashimi/theywhiteboardedme) are welcome and
encouraged!

Devs love pull requests :).
