From coding challenges that measure the wrong things, to demoralizing whiteboarding / live-coding
interviews that only seem to cause and placate impostor syndrome, it is obvious that things are
broken.

It's time that tech workers demand a better interview process. How do we do that? Simple!

## Step 1
Read up on why [whiteboarding is bad](/faq.html).

## Step 2
Review this list of companies:

- [Companies that whiteboard](/companies-that-whiteboard.html)
- [Companies that don't whiteboard](/companies-that-dont-whiteboard.html)

## Step 3
- If you don't work at a company that whiteboards. Awesome! Send [PR](https://github.com/cheesesashimi/theywhiteboardedme) if you're not on the [list](/companies-that-dont-whiteboard.html).
- If you work at a company that whiteboards, please read up on why [whiteboarding is bad](/faq.html) and persuade your senior leadership to change their ways.
- If you are job-hunting, only apply to companies that do not whiteboard. Refuse to interview with those who do.

## Step 4
- If you notice a company is missing, please send a [PR](https://github.com/cheesesashimi/theywhiteboardedme).
- If you'd prefer to remain anonymous, you can use this [form](https://goo.gl/forms/Usy158YeCBA99wT53).
