## Introduction

From coding challenges that measure the wrong things, to demoralizing
whiteboarding or live-coding interviews that only seem to cause and placate
impostor syndrome, reduce diversity and place applicants under significant
stress, it is obvious that things are broken.

It's time that tech workers demand a better interview process. How do we do
that? Simple!

## Step 1
Review these lists of companies:

- [Companies that whiteboard](/companies-that-whiteboard.html)
- [Companies that don't whiteboard](/companies-that-dont-whiteboard.html)

## Step 2
The next step depends on where you are and what you're doing:

### I'm looking for a job
If you are looking for a job, only apply and accept interview requests with
companies that do not whiteboard. Decline interview requests with companies
that do. Be sure to explain why you are declining to interview with a given
company.

If you encounter a company that is not on either of the lists, please get in
touch:

{% include contact.md %}

### I am not looking for a job and my company does not whiteboard
Awesome! Send a {% include pull_requests.md text="pull request" %} or open
a [GitHub issue](http://github.com/cheesesashimi/theywhiteboardedme/issues) if
your company is not on [the list](/companies-that-dont-whiteboard.html). If you
prefer to {% include anonymous_post.md text="post anonymously" %}, please feel
free. You will get a lot of awesome people coming your way.

### I am not looking for a job and my company whiteboards
Please have a look at why [whiteboarding is bad](/faq.html). This next part is
easier said than done, but please fix your process. It will benefit you in the
long run. Plus, you will be removed from the
[list](/companies-that-whiteboard.html).
