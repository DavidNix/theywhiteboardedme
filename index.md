From coding challenges that measure the wrong things, to demoralizing
whiteboarding or live-coding interviews that only seem to cause and placate
impostor syndrome, it is obvious that things are broken.

It's time that tech workers demand a better interview process. How do we do
that? Simple!

## Step 1
Review these lists of companies:

- [Companies that whiteboard](/companies-that-whiteboard.html)
- [Companies that don't whiteboard](/companies-that-dont-whiteboard.html)

## Step 2
### I'm job-hunting
If you are job-hunting, only apply and accept interview requests with companies
that do not whiteboard. Do not apply and do not accept interview requests with
companies that insist on whiteboarding.

If you encounter an automated coding challenge, live-coding or whiteboarding
interview, please share it with the world:

- {% include pull_requests.md text="Pull requests" %} welcomed.
- {% include anonymous_post.md text="Anonymous submissions" %} also welcomed.
- Create a [Glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com) submission.

### I'm not job-hunting, but my company does not whiteboard
Awesome! Send a {% include pull_requests.md text="pull request" %} if your
company is not on the [list](/companies-that-dont-whiteboard.html). If you
prefer to {% include anonymous_post.md text="post anonymously" %}, please feel
free. You will get a lot of awesome people coming your way.

### I'm not job-hunting, but my company whiteboards
Please have a look at why [whiteboarding is bad](/faq.html). This next part is
easier said than done, but please fix your process. It will benefit you in the
long run. Plus, you will be removed from the
[list](/companies-that-whiteboard.html).
