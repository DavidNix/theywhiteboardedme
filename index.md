From coding challenges that measure the wrong things, to demoralizing whiteboarding / live-coding
interviews that only seem to cause and placate impostor syndrome, it is obvious that things are
broken.

It's time that tech workers demand a better interview process. How do we do that? Simple! Have a look
at the following lists of companies:

## Step 1
Review this list of companies:

- [Companies that whiteboard](/companies-that-whiteboard.html)
- [Comanies that don't whiteboard](/companies-that-dont-whiteboard.html)

## Step 2
Apply to work at companies that do not whiteboard. Do not apply and refuse to interview with those who do.

## Step 3
If you notice a company is missing, please send a [PR](https://github.com/cheesesashimi/theywhiteboardedme). If
you'd prefer to remain anonymous, you can use this [form](https://goo.gl/forms/Usy158YeCBA99wT53).
