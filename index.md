From coding challenges that measure the wrong things, to demoralizing
whiteboarding / live-coding interviews that only seem to cause and placate
impostor syndrome, it is obvious that things are broken.

It's time that tech workers demand a better interview process. How do we do
that? Simple!

## Step 1
Review these lists of companies:

- [Companies that whiteboard](/companies-that-whiteboard.html)
- [Companies that don't whiteboard](/companies-that-dont-whiteboard.html)

## Step 2
- If you work at a company that does not whiteboard, awesome! Send
  a [PR](https://github.com/cheesesashimi/theywhiteboardedme) if your company is
  not on the [list](/companies-that-dont-whiteboard.html).
- If you work at a company that whiteboards, please read up on why
  [whiteboarding is bad](/faq.html).
- If you are job-hunting, only apply and interview with companies that do not
  whiteboard. Do not apply and do not interview with companies that insist on
  the practice.
- If you'd prefer to remain anonymous, use this
  [form](https://goo.gl/forms/Usy158YeCBA99wT53).
