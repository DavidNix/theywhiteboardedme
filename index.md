From coding challenges that measure the wrong things, to demoralizing
whiteboarding / live-coding interviews that only seem to cause and placate
impostor syndrome, it is obvious that things are broken.

It's time that tech workers demand a better interview process. How do we do
that? Simple!

## Step 1
Review these lists of companies:

- [Companies that whiteboard](/companies-that-whiteboard.html)
- [Companies that don't whiteboard](/companies-that-dont-whiteboard.html)

## Step 2
- If you work at a company that does not whiteboard, awesome! Send
  a [PR](https://github.com/cheesesashimi/theywhiteboardedme) if your company
  is not on the [list](/companies-that-dont-whiteboard.html). If you prefer
  to remain anonymous, you can use this
  [form](https://goo.gl/forms/Usy158YeCBA99wT53).
- If you work at a company that whiteboards, please read up on why
  [whiteboarding is bad](/faq.html). This next part is easier said than done,
  but please fix your process. It will benefit you in the long run.
- If you are actively or passively job-hunting, only apply and accept interview
  requests with companies that do not whiteboard. Do not apply and do not
  accept interview requests with companies that insist on whiteboarding.

## Step 3

If you encounter an automated coding challenge, live-coding or whiteboarding
interview, please share it with the world. Feel free to send
a [pull request](https://github.com/cheesesashimi/theywhiteboardedme) or submit an
anonymous entry [here](https://goo.gl/forms/Usy158YeCBA99wT53). If
[Glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com) is more your thing, feel free to post
there.
